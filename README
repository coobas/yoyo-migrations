A simple database migration utility.

Requires Storm, but will work in projects using another (or no) ORM, as long as
the Storm package is installed.

Usage::

	torque-migrate --all mysql://user:password@localhost/datbase /path/to/migrations

Each migration file must be a .py script with a unique name, containing upward
and downward migration information. For example::

	up = [
		"CREATE TABLE foo (id INT, bar VARCHAR(20), PRIMARY KEY (id))"
	]
	down = [
		"DROP TABLE foo"
	]

Save all migration files in the same directory. The filename (without the .py
extension) will be used as an identifier for each migration.
