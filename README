A simple database migration utility that uses only SQL and the DB-API.

Usage::

	yoyo-migrate apply postgres://user:password@localhost/datbase ./migrations
	yoyo-migrate rollback postgres://user:password@localhost/datbase ./migrations

Each migration file must be a .py script with a unique name, containing
migration and rollback information. For example::

	step(
		"CREATE TABLE foo (id INT, bar VARCHAR(20), PRIMARY KEY (id))",
		"DROP TABLE foo",
		ignore_errors=True
	)

The first statement is the migration. The second is a rollback step which will
be called if the first statement fails. Note that this is necessary because in
MySQL and other databases DDL statements are not run in transactions.

For regular SQL, no rollback statement is required if you are using a
transactional database.

Save all migration files in the same directory. The filename (without the .py
extension) will be used as an identifier for each migration.
